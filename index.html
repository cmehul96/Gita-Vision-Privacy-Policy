                                         <li><strong>Device Information:</strong> We collect information about your mobile device, including the device model, operating system, unique device identifiers (a randomly generated, non-personally identifiable ID used for analytics), and mobile network information (for analytics and troubleshooting). We do <em>not</em> collect your IMEI.</li>
                                        <li><strong>Usage Data:</strong> We collect <em>anonymous</em> information about how you use the App, such as the verses you read, the features you use (search, bookmarks, etc.), your preferred language, theme settings (light/dark mode, font size), and the time and date of your use. This data is used in an aggregated and anonymized form to improve the App and understand user preferences. We do <em>not</em> track individual reading habits in a personally identifiable way.</li>
                                        <li><strong>Offline Content:</strong> If you choose to download content for offline access, that content is stored locally on your device.</li>
                                        <li><strong>Location Data:</strong> We <em>do not</em> collect your precise geolocation data.</li>
                                        <li><strong>Crash Reports:</strong> We receive automated, anonymized crash reports when the application unexpectedly crashes. This data helps us find bugs and improve the stability of the application. These reports do not contain any personally identifiable information.</li>
                                    </ul>
                                </li>

                                        <li><strong>Google Analytics/Firebase:</strong> We use Google Analytics/Firebase to collect <em>anonymous</em> usage data and crash reports to help us improve the App. We have configured Google Analytics/Firebase to anonymize IP addresses. You can learn more about Google's privacy practices here: <a href="https://policies.google.com/privacy" target="_blank">https://policies.google.com/privacy</a></li>
                                        <li><strong>Social Media Sharing:</strong> If you choose to share a verse using the built-in sharing functionality, the App will interact with the selected third-party app (e.g., your messaging app, social media app). We do <em>not</em> receive any information back from these third-party apps when you share. The sharing action is initiated entirely on your device.</li>
                                    </ul>
                                </li>

                                <li><strong>To Improve the App:</strong> To analyze <em>anonymous</em> usage patterns, understand user preferences, develop new features, fix bugs, and improve the overall quality and performance of the App.</li>

                                <li><strong>For Security Purposes:</strong> To detect, prevent, and address technical issues and security vulnerabilities.</li>
                                <li><strong>To Comply with Legal Obligations:</strong> To comply with applicable laws, regulations, and legal processes.</li>

                            <p>We may share your information in the following circumstances:</p>
                            <ul>
                                <li><strong>With Your Consent:</strong> We will only share your information with third parties if you have given us your <em>explicit</em> consent to do so.</li>
                                <li><strong>With Service Providers:</strong> We use Google (Firebase/Analytics) as a service provider for analytics and crash reporting, as described above.

                                <li><strong>For Legal Reasons:</strong> We may disclose your information if required to do so by law or in response to a valid legal request, such as a subpoena, court order, or government investigation.</li>

                                <li><strong>Aggregated or De-identified Data:</strong> We may share aggregated or de-identified usage data (which cannot reasonably be used to identify you) with third parties for research, analytics, or other purposes.</li>

                            </ul>

                            <h5>5. Your Choices and Rights</h5>
                               <p>
                                <ul>
                                  <li><strong>Data Deletion:</strong> Your bookmarks, notes, and highlights are stored locally on your device. You can delete this data by uninstalling the App.</li>

                                  <li><strong>Do Not Track:</strong> The App does not currently respond to "Do Not Track" signals from web browsers.</li>
                                  <li><strong>Your Rights Under GDPR and CCPA:</strong> If you are a resident of the European Economic Area (EEA) or California, you have certain additional rights under the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) and the California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA), respectively. These rights may include the right to access, rectify, erase, restrict processing, data portability, and object to processing of your personal information. To exercise these rights with respect to the <em>anonymous</em> data we collect, please contact us at [Your Contact Email Address]. Note that since bookmarks, notes, and highlights are stored <em>only</em> on your device, we do not have access to them and cannot fulfill access, rectification, or portability requests for that data.</li>
                                </ul>
                               </p>

                            <h5>6. Data Security</h5>
                            <p>We take reasonable measures to protect your information from unauthorized access, use, or disclosure. These measures include:</p>
                            <ul>
                                <li>Data stored locally on your device (bookmarks, notes, highlights) is protected by your device's security features.</li>
                                <li>We use secure servers provided by Google Firebase for <em>anonymous</em> analytics and crash reporting.</li>
                                <li>We limit access to anonymous usage data to authorized personnel only.</li>
                            </ul>
                            <p>However, no method of transmission over the internet or method of electronic storage is 100% secure. Therefore, we cannot guarantee the absolute security of your information.</p>

                            <h5>7. Children's Privacy</h5>
                            <p>The App is not intended for children under the age of 13. We do not knowingly collect personal information from children under 13. If you are a parent or guardian and believe that your child has provided us with personal information, please contact us at [Your Contact Email Address].
